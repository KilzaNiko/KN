If you wish to create your own scripts or overwrite existing scripts, use custom.txt file to write the script data.
The scriptlist.txt contains the scripts that will be read from custom.txt.
*Note: Default scripts such as _Config, _Filter, _Hourly, Farm Rare, Farm Golem, Farm Astromon, Farm Gem, Farm Guardian, and Farm Starstone
	are hosted remotely on the github page. You can still overwrite and modify these scripts, but you will have to make changes to the actual script
	functions to fit the number of parameters.

Custom scripts should have functions declared as the script name (Replacing spaces with underscores (_)).
	- Example: "Farm Rare" script will have a respective function called "Farm_Rare(...)".
Functions should have the same amount of parameters as it has fields on script data; otherwise, the script will not run.
If a function name starts with an underscore (_) then it is not expected to have a function.

Script data structure goes as follows:
	- Note: Any whitespace outside of a quotation block will ignored.
		Replace any spaces in script name with underscores.
		Any syntax errors will cause an error.
		Cannot have quotation marks inside a quotation mark. Use apostrophe if needed.
		All field inside a config should be followed by a quoted string.
	- Available types: text, combo, list, setting
		combo and list should have a data that contains a list separated by commas. Ex: "value1,value2,value3".
	- For more examples, look at the remote data in github and functions in local files.
