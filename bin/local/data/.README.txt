Pixel set note: The '|' character acts as an AND operator. The '/' character acts as an OR operator. This can be used in locations.txt and pixels.txt.
For example: 18,25,0xF1C444|31,24,0xF3C645/794,539,0xEBDC59|790,544,0xEBDC59
- There are two parts to look at which are 18,25,0xF1C444|31,24,0xF3C645 and 794,539,0xEBDC59|790,544,0xEBDC59.
- If either parts are true then the whole thing is true. If all parts are false then the result is false.
- In 18,25,0xF1C444|31,24,0xF3C645, all parts of this set must be true for it to pass.
- These can be combined to form basic boolean logic.
=========================

locations.txt:
-Note: setLocation(LOCATION, [DATA]) can write existing or new locations.
	- setLocation(EXISITINGLOCATION) will get the pixels based on existing point data.
	- setLocation(NEWLOCATION, "x,y|x,y") will create an entirely new location.
If the same local and remote location exists, then the local location will be appended using an OR operator.
Check the pixel set note above.
